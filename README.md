<h1 align="center">GIF - Got it First</h1>

<h3>Taking screenshots of the specific position, convert it to a string (text) format, copy automatically and use where ever you want. You can even implement it to do the next steps itself.</h3>

<h1>Getting started</h1>
To begin with, start downloading the github repo on your device.

<h1>Setting Up</h1>
As soon as you get the repo on your device, make sure to get following python libraries also.
<p> > Pillow (PIL)</p>
<p> > pytesseract </p>
<p> > pathlib </p>
<p> > (optinal) time (for the automation of the further steps) </p>

<h1>Quick Notes: </h1>
<p> 1. Version 1 (Current) verison of the code works for only high quality and not noisy texts as it uses a special library for it.
<p> 2. Arrange the area of where you want to take the screenshot and resize after it manually (take screenshot of your main display and paste into paint to check it).</p>
<p> 3. I will be improving this project by using <b>Machine Learning</b> and <b>Trained</b> model integration to make it more accurate and almost always working whether the background and the text is blurry, noisy or etc.</p>
